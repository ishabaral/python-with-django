## Test Your Knowledge: Quiz
1. What are the six main reasons that people choose to use Python?
   > The main reasons to choose python are:
   >   1. Code is easy to read, use and maintain
   >   2. Supports multiple programming paradigms i.e Procedural programming, Object-oriented programming and functional programming
   >   3. Compatible with major operating systems like Windows, Linux, macOS, etc. and architectures like Intel *86, PPC64, etc.
   >  4. Large standard library
   >  5. Cost-effective approach
   >  6. Simplifies the complexities of software development

2. Name four notable companies or organizations using Python today.
   > - Google
   > - Netflix
   > - Dropbox
   > - Instagram 

3. Why might you not want to use Python in an application?
   >- Slower than C or C++
   >- Not a very good language for mobile development
   >- Not a good choice for memory intensive tasks
   >- Python's database access layer is found to be a bit underdeveloped and primitive compared to JDBC AND ODBC

4. What can you do with Python?
   >- Web Development with frameworks like Django and Flask
   >- Data Science — including machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization
   >- Creating bots
   >- Scraping websites
   >- Game development with Pygame
   >- Mobile apps with frameworks like Kivy

5. What’s the significance of the Python import this statement?
   > The Python programming language comes with a variety of built-in functions like print(), abs(), int(), len(), etc. <br/>
  However these built-in functions are limited, and we can make use of `modules` to make more sophisticated programs. <br/>
  Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module by the process of importing it. <br>
  Modules are Python .py files that consist of Python code. Any Python file can be referenced as a module. A Python file called hello.py has the module name of hello that can be imported into other Python files or used on the Python command line interpreter.

6. Why does “spam” show up in so many Python examples in books and on the Web?
   > Spam is a common variable name in Python scripts. It is a piece of Python software built upon NumPy and SciPy for the analysis and manipulation of 3D and 2D data sets in material science. So they appear in Python examples.

7. What is your favorite color?
   > My favorite color is orange.

1. What is the Python interpreter?
   >The Python interpreter is a virtual machine, meaning that it is software that emulates a physical computer. The Python interpreter is a bytecode interpreter: its input is instruction sets called bytecode. When you write Python, the lexer, parser, and compiler generate code objects for the interpreter to operate on.

2. What is source code?
   >Source code is the sequence of programming language statements written by a programmer. It can be read and easily understood by a human being. After compiling source code, byte code is generated.

3. What is byte code?
   >The bytecode is a low-level platform-independent representation of your source code, however, it is not the binary machine code and cannot be run by the target machine directly. In fact, it is a set of instructions for a virtual machine which is called the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

4. What is the PVM?
   >The PVM (Python Virtual Machine) is an interpreter that runs the bytecode and is part of the Python system. The bytecode is platform-independent, but PVM is specific to the target machine. After compilation, the bytecode is sent for execution to the PVM.
   PVM is also called Python Interpreter and this is the reason Python is called an Interpreted language.

5. Name two or more variations on Python’s standard execution model.
   >

6. How are CPython, Jython, and IronPython different?
   >The default implementation of the Python programming language is CPython which is written in the C programming language. CPython compiles the python source code into the bytecode, and this bytecode is then executed by the CPython virtual machine.

7. What are Stackless and PyPy?
