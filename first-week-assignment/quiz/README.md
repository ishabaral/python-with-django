5. What’s the significance of the Python import this statement?
   > The Python programming language comes with a variety of built-in functions like print(), abs(), int(), len(), etc. <br/>
  However these built-in functions are limited, and we can make use of `modules` to make more sophisticated programs. <br/>
  Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module by the process of importing it. <br>
  Modules are Python .py files that consist of Python code. Any Python file can be referenced as a module. A Python file called hello.py has the module name of hello that can be imported into other Python files or used on the Python command line interpreter.
