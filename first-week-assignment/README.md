## Projects :

1. Open a Python shell, enter the following expressions, and observe the results:
    ```python
    a. 8
    b. 8 * 2
    c. 8 ** 2
    d. 8/12
    e. 8 // 12
    f. 8/0
    ```
2. Write a Python program that prints (displays) your name, address, and telephone number

3. Evaluate the following code at a shell prompt: print("Your name is", name). Then assign name an appropriate value, and evaluate the statement again.

4. Write and test a program that accepts the user's name(as text) and age(as a number) as input. The program should output a sentense containing the user's name and age.

5. Write and test a program that computes the area of a circle. This program should request a number representing a radius as input from the user. It should use the formula 3.14radius*2 to compute the area and then output this result suitably labeled.

6. Enter an input statement using the input function at the shll prompt. When the prompt asks you for input, enter a number. Then, attempt to add 1 to that number, observe the results and explain what happened.

7. Enter the expression help() at the shell prompt. Follow the instructions to browse the topics and modules.

8. The tax calculator program of the case study outputs a floating-point number that might show more than two digits of precision. Use the round function to modify the program to display at most two digits of precision in the output number.

9. You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge. Write a program that takes the length of an edge(an integer) as input and prints the cube's surface area as output.

10. Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to buy LP record albums. The store rents new videos for  3.00anight,andoldiesfor 2.00 a night.
Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video can use to calculate the total charge for a customer’s video rentals.
The program should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total cost.

11.  Write a program that takes the radius of a sphere(a floating point number) as input and then outputs the sphere's diameter, circumference, surface area and volume.

12.  Instructions An object's momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity. Write a program that accepts an object's mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as inputs, and then outputs its momentum.

13.  The kinetic energy of a moving object is given by the formula KE = ½mv2 where m is the object’s mass and v is its velocity.
Modify the program you created in Project 5 so that it prints the object’s kinetic energy as well as its momentum.

14. An employee’s total weekly pay equals the hourly wage multiplied by the total number of regular hours plus any overtime pay. Overtime pay equals the total overtime hours multiplied by 1.5 times the hourly wage. Write a program that takes as inputs the hourly wage, total regular hours, and total overtime hours and displays an employee’s total weekly pay.
